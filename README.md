Iâ€™ve been building software in C++ since the first edition of *Effective C++* inspired me. As a professional developer, I most enjoy hands-on work in modern C++, especially for reliable, maintainable embedded and Linux systems. Iâ€™m always exploring ways to apply modern C++ practices to systems and embedded software.
